# DevOps Project Repository

Welcome to the **DevOps Project** repository! In this repository, you will find all the necessary instructions, configuration files, and steps required to deploy an application. This project will guide you through setting up and automating the deployment process in a step-by-step manner using Jenkins, Docker, and other DevOps tools.

## Repository Structure

### 1. **Application Code Repository**

The **application** you will be deploying is stored in a separate repository:

- [Application Repository](https://github.com/ooluwgb/APPLICATION.git)

You will be working with this application during the deployment process, but all instructions and configuration files for setting up the deployment are located in this repository.

### 2. **Instructions and Configuration Files Repository**

This repository contains all the instructions and configuration files needed to complete the project. You are currently in the **DevOps Project** repository:

- [DevOps Project Repository](https://github.com/ooluwgb/DevopsProject.git)

In this repository, you will find a directory called `Jenkins-job/` which contains numbered projects. These projects are to be completed **in the order of their numbering**.
