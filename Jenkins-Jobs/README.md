# Jenkins-job Instructions

Welcome to the **Jenkins-job** directory! Here, you will find the step-by-step projects that will guide you through the deployment of the application.

## Important Notes:

1. **Follow the Numbering**: The projects are numbered for a reason. You should follow the order of the numbering starting from **001-**, then moving to **002-**, and so on, as each project builds upon the previous one.

2. **Repository References**: These repositories are not under your registry by default. Every time you need to set up a repository URL or push code, ensure that you are referencing **your personal repository** URLs and not the default ones listed in the instructions.

Make sure to complete each project fully before moving on to the next one.
